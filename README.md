# Resproduced-VR-EyeTracking
In this work we are providing an access to a reproduced version of VR-EyeTracking Dataset.
VR-EyeTracking Dataset consists  of  208  diverse  content  4k  ODVs.  The head/eye saccades were obtained from 45 participants. 
However,no  fixation  and  saliency  maps  were  published  publicly before now. Here We processed the gaze recording to obtain the 2048×1024 fixation maps.
Saliency maps are generated by convolving each fixationpoint (for all observers of one video) with a Gaussian filter, with σ= 9.35◦for head and eye data.
The processed datasetis now available at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y6hCYOdn7BbBguxfBfOhgoUW_1DygET1?usp=sharing).
